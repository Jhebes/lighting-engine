                What is this?
            </h1>
            <strong>Short Story:</strong> This is a *really* simple 2D lighting engine built on A*. Your mouse is the light source, and you can click and drag to create walls that block the light.
            <br><br>
            Longer version:
            This is makes use of four major event handlers:
            <ul>
                <li>mousemove</li>
                <li>click</li>
                <li>DOMContentLoaded</li>
                <li>resize</li>
            </ul>
            I use DOMContentLoaded and resize to generate a grid of cells onto a canvas element. The state of these cells is maintained in a 2D array of objects that contain the color and the geometry, as well as a function needed for the cell to draw itself. The resize listener ensures that the grid is always the exact size of your browser window.
            <br><br>
            Once this is done, I listen for mousemove events and determine which cell the mouse is over. I set the color of this cell to 255 white. In order to appropriately light the other cells, I then path to every other cell with A* and set the brightness based on the length of the path. In this example, brightness falls off at a ratio proportional to the inverse square-root of the distance. Sort of. I found inverse square-root to fall off too quickly to be interesting, so the power of the denominator is actually around 1.1, which is approaching a linear fall off. As you can see, the pattern of light falloff is actually less circular than natural, and that's the reason. 
            <br><br>
            Finally, I've bound up click to start the process for creating walls, which ends when the mouse is released. These walls act as obstructions, preventing "light" from passing through them.
            <h2>Why A*?</h2>
            There's probably better lighting pattern algorithms somewhere, but I picked A* for a few reasons. Primarily A* doesn't need to preprocess the graph. This is pretty huge, as creating an optimal route table for every cell to every other cell could be pretty costly, and I didn't want to have the page take a few seconds to load in. Additionally, as soon as you place a wall, _every_single_table_ would have to update. That's really just not practical. Something like A* can run on the fly for each node and be reasonably speedy. It may be possible to run something like Dijkstra's for each node, but I haven't done the calculations to determine if this is faster than running A* to every other node on the graph. However, the choice of algorithm here I think is beyond the scope of what I'm trying to accomplish here, as the end product will be the same either way; it will only affect how many cells I can reasonably have in my grid. Right now, I find I really can't better do than ~30x30 on my machine without lag.
